Screen reader users have various options for what type of content their device reads.
These options include skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the headings.
Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.

Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (a) tags. Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful.
Instead, use brief but descriptive text within the a tags to provide more meaning for these users.
