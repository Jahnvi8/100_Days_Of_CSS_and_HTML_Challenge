You can group cells of your grid together into an area and give the area a custom name. Do this by using grid-template-areas on the container like this:

grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";
The code above merges the top three cells together into an area named header, the bottom three cells into a footer area, and it makes two areas in the middle row; advert and content. Note: Every word in the code represents a cell and every pair of quotation marks represent a row. In addition to custom labels, you can use a period (.) to designate an empty cell in the grid.
