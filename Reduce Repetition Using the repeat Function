When you used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the structure of a grid, you entered a value for each row or column you created.

Let's say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. It isn't very practical to insert 100 values individually.
Fortunately, there's a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you want your column or row to be repeated,
followed by a comma and the value you want to repeat.

Here's an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.

grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);

You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when defining a grid structure. Here's what that looks like:

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;

This translates to:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;

Note: The 1fr 50px is repeated twice followed by 20px.
