After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);

This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable.
Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.
