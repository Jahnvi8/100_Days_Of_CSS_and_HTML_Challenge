The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. 
Recall that flex-shrink controls the size of the items when the container shrinks. 
The flex-grow property controls the size of items when the parent container expands.

Using a similar example from the last challenge, 
if one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.
