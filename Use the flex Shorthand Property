There is a shortcut available to set several flex properties at once. 
The flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties can all be set together by using the flex property.

For example, flex: 1 0 10px; will set the item to flex-grow: 1;, flex-shrink: 0;, and flex-basis: 10px;.

The default property settings are flex: 0 1 auto;.
