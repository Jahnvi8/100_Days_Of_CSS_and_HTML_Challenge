HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.
Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the </ol> tag.

For example:

<ol>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ol>
..
would create a numbered list of Garfield and Sylvester.

OUTPUT:
1. Milk
2. Bread
