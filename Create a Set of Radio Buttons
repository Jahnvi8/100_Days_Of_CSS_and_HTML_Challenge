You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

Radio buttons are a type of input.
Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element.
By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group.
By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

Here's an example of a radio button:

<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element,
with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. 
This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element. 

For example:

<input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
<label for="indoor">Indoor</label>

We can also nest the input element within the label tags:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
