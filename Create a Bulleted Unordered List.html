HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.
Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a </ul>

For example:

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
...     this would create a bullet point style list of milk and cheese.
