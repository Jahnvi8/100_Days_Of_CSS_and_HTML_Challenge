In CSS Grid, the content of each item is located in a box which is referred to as a cell.
You can align the content's position within its cell horizontally using the justify-self property on a grid item.
By default, this property has a value of stretch, which will make the content fill the whole width of the cell. This CSS Grid property accepts other values as well:

start: aligns the content at the left of the cell,

center: aligns the content in the center of the cell,

end: aligns the content at the right of the cell.
