CSS Grid can be an easy way to make your site more responsive by using media queries to rearrange grid areas, 
change dimensions of a grid, and rearrange the placement of items.

In the preview, when the viewport width is 300px or more, the number of columns changes from 1 to 2.
The advertisement area then occupies the left column completely.
