Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the margin of all four individual sides of an element with the
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties.

.blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
     margin-top: 40px;
    margin-right: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-left: 40px;
  }
