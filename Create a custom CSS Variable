To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:

--penguin-skin: gray;

This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the value of gray.
Now you can use that variable elsewhere in your CSS to change the value of other elements to gray.
