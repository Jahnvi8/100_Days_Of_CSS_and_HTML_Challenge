The next form topic covers the accessibility of radio buttons. 
Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge.
Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.

The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this.
It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which screen readers read for each choice in the fieldset element.

The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection.
Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.

Here's an example:

<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
