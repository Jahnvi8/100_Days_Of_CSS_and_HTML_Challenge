This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. 
A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector.
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
