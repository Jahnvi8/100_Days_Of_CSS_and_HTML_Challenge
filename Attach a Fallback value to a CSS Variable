When using your variable as a CSS property value, you can attach a fallback value that your browser will revert to if the given variable is invalid.

Note: This fallback is not used to increase browser compatibility, and it will not work on IE browsers.
Rather, it is used so that the browser has a color to display if it cannot find your variable.

Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);

This will set background to black if your variable wasn't set.
Note that this can be useful for debugging.
