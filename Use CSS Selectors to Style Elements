With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

When you entered <h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a style block like this:

<style>
</style>

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. 
For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.
