The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.

The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.
