The final property for flex items is align-self.
This property allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually, instead of setting them all at once. 
This is useful since other common adjustment techniques using the CSS properties float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex items.

align-self accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the align-items property.
