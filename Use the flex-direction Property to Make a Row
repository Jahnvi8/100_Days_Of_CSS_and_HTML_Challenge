Adding display: flex to an element turns it into a flex container. 
This makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or columns. 
You do this by adding the flex-direction property to the parent item and setting it to row or column.
Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children vertically.

Other options for flex-direction are row-reverse and column-reverse.

Note: The default value for the flex-direction property is row.
