Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to define the structure of the grid as well. 
To add some columns to the grid, use the grid-template-columns property on a grid container as demonstrated below:

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
}
This will give your grid two columns that are each 50px wide. 
The number of parameters given to the grid-template-columns property indicates the number of columns in the grid,
and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.
