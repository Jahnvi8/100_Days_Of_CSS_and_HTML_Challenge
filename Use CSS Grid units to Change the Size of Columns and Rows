You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns.
You can use these as well:

fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,

auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

%: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.

Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:

grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;

This snippet creates five columns.
The first column is as wide as its content,
the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container,
and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, 
two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.
