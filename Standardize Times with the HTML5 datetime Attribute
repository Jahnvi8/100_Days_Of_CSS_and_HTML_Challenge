Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. 
The time element is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A datetime attribute holds a valid format of that date.
This is the value accessed by assistive devices. 
It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's informally or colloquially written in the text.

Here's an example:

<p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion <time datetime="2013-02-13">last Wednesday</time>, which ended in a draw.</p>
