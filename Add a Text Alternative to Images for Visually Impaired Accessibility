You've likely seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. 
alt text describes the image's content and provides a text-alternative for it. 
An alt attribute helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. Search engines also use it to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:

<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">

People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. 
They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image.
Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.
