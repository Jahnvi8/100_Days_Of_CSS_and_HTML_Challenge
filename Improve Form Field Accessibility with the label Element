Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names and attributes.
The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.

The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. 
This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. 
The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.

You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. 
In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a label element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable.
Another way to achieve this is by using the for attribute, as explained in this lesson.

The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control. Here's an example:

<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
