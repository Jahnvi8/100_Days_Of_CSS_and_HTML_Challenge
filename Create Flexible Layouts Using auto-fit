auto-fit works almost identically to auto-fill.
The only difference is that when the container's size exceeds the size of all the items combined,
auto-fill keeps inserting empty rows or columns and pushes your items to the side,
while auto-fit collapses those empty rows or columns and stretches your items to fit the size of the container.

Note: If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.
