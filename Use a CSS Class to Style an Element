Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>. 
Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.
